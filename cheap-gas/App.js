//IDEA: Make it easy to know how long it will take and where to go to charge your electric car

//Pesudocode:

//App main page:
//  Display logo, battery level
// FOR BATTERY LEVEL - hardcode this data for now
//                   - Synthesize this data from: odo reading at last "fill" + battery capacity in miles  and the current odo reading.
// and number of miles left
// IF number of miles left is below threshold value then:
// Bring up alert form -> "your car battery is low, do you want me to find a charging station?"


// If no > do nothing

// If yes to ^ then:
// ======= display list of charging stations WITH
//    the actual time it will take you to charge to full

//once one is selected: open a map to navigate there.
